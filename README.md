**A JavaScript-powered clipboard. Contains an offline emoji keyboard.**

This is, in essence, just a fun little experiment to see if I could code a self-generating emoji keyboard from the Unicode Consortium's table of emojis from the latest revision of the standard. To see the final product, just open the index.html file. If you want to dig into the code, just open the emoji_keyboard.js file.

*NOTE:* This is a personal experimentation project, made just for fun. I know this type of thing has been done before, but I just wanted to try my hand at it.
