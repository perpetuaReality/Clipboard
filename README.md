# Clipboard
**A JavaScript-powered clipboard. Contains an offline emoji keyboard.**

This is, in essence, just a fun little experiment to see if I could code a self-generating emoji keyboard from the Unicode Consortium's table of emojis from the latest revision of the standard. To see the final product, please visit https://perpetuareality.github.io/Clipboard/. If you want to dig into the code, just open the emoji_keyboard.js file.

*NOTE:* This is a personal experimentation project, made just for fun. I know this type of thing has been done before, but I just wanted to try my hand at it.
